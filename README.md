# Credits:
1. The awesome people that wrote https://socket.io/get-started/chat/ and built socket.io
2. Jquery team

# Scope for Improvement:
Jquery is used to append HTML elements to the list.
Angular could've been better and efficiently used to bind HTML.
Material Design would've been great !

# HomeWork

1. Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
2. Add support for nicknames
3. Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
4. Add “{user} is typing” functionality
5. Show who’s online
6. Add private messaging
